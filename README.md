*Network* also strives to accomplish it's tasks beautifully, in order to make playing Minecraft a pleasure!
### Contributions
I welcome pull requests, especially bug fixes! If you feel so inclined to add a new feature, I recommend talking to me first, since I have a specific vision of which direction this mod should go, and I don't want people to waste their time coding something I won't implement.
